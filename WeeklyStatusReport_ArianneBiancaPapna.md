<br>Project Name: JMGTCC Booking & Reservation System<br>
<br>
<h1>Details</h1>
<hr />
<h2>Week 1: January 26 - 31 , 2015</h2>

<h3>A. Tasks accomplished</h3>

As the project manager, I checked and made some revisions on the initial project proposal. I also gathered some information needed for the system requirements from the client.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>B. Problems encountered</h3>

There were some requirements that are in need to be finalized, some were unclear.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>C. Possible solutions</h3>

The requirements should be finalized. Some system requirements, like the direct flight booking, should first be negotiated with the partner airlines, so our proposal was to create a module for travel arrangement requests instead of the direct booking and reservation.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>D. Next steps to accomplish</h3>

Start designing the database. The documentation should also be started as early as possible to avoid conflicts during the system development, as well as updating of the project wiki page.<br>
<br>
<br>

<h2>Week 2: February 2 - 7 , 2015</h2>

<h3>A. Tasks accomplished</h3>

For this week, the initial database design has been made. A time table and project schedule were also made and considered for a more organized project development.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>B. Problems encountered</h3>

The database design has not been fully checked by our project advisers.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>C. Possible solutions</h3>

Frequent communication with the client and project advisers should be done to have a clear understanding of the requirements and system design.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>D. Next steps to accomplish</h3>

We have to submit a copy of the Project Adviser Form, with the signature of Sir JoeGene, to our project advisers. We also need to settle our consultation time with them for weekly meetings. The development of some system modules should be started before the week ended, next week.<br>
<br>
<hr />
<h2>Week 3: February 9 - 14 , 2015</h2>

<h3>A. Tasks accomplished</h3>

The installation of Yii framework has been made and the familiarization of the framework and project structure has been done. For this week, the system UI for the homepage was initially designed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>B. Problems encountered</h3>

The framework is new to the group and the members haven't used PHP in creating a system before; The group was used to Java programming from the past 3 years.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>C. Possible solutions</h3>

The group must review or study PHP programming language more and must understand how it works. Yii framework must also be studied further, as well as its processes and structures.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>D. Next steps to accomplish</h3>

We have to start the documentation as early as next week to prevent conflicts with the schedule and other subjects. starting one documentation section at a time would be fine.<br>
<br>

<h2>Week 4: February 16 - 21 , 2015</h2>

<h3>A. Tasks accomplished</h3>

For this week, the member made some revisions on the database design. For the project application, MVC has been made and implemented for database parent tables (roles, airlines, contact number).<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>B. Problems encountered</h3>

Since the database has not yet been checked by this week, the team considered the design as roughly correct; Database normalization has been considered.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>C. Possible solutions</h3>

The database design should be checked by the project adviser for correction and approval.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>D. Next steps to accomplish</h3>

Have a consultation with the project adviser and continue developing the project application.<br>
<br>

<h2>Week 5: February 23 - 28 , 2015</h2>

The database design has been updated, new fields were added and new tables were created. MVC has also been created and implemented for these new parent and floating tables. Since an advanced template has been incorporated to the project application, the UI design has been updated as well.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>B. Problems encountered</h3>

This week, the team had a consultation with the project adviser. Some database entities have been questioned and the team has been asked to revise some entities and connections.<br>
<br>
<h3>C. Possible solutions</h3>

The database design should be revised.<br>
<br>
<h3>D. Next steps to accomplish</h3>

For the advance template used in the application, the team must study the template structure and continue developing the application. The database design should also be revised or updated.<br>
