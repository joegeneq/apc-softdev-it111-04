<h2>Week 1: January 26 - January 31</h2><br>
<b>A. Tasks accomplished</b>
<blockquote>Final project and client was finalized this week, together with the planned added feature for the 	booking and reservation system and the groups preferred advisors in which the team was able to 	talk with and agreed to be their mentors for the project.<br>
This week the member was able to get a hold and understand the existing system through the 	given project management plan and wiki site of the project. Resources needed for the 	development of the project was also prepared this week including the installation of yii and setting 	up the GitHub repository and familiarizing with yii’s interface</blockquote>

<b>B. Problems encountered</b>
<blockquote>This week involved a lot of confusion because of the sudden idea of connecting our SOFTDEV 	project in our TENTREPS class and how we are going to handle it since we have different teams 	for each class.<br>
Another problem was the added requirement that the client wanted and it involves connecting 	with the database server of hotels and airlines in which the team was really reluctant to have 	because of the data privacy that this establishments have and coordinating with them will take a 	lot of time.<br>
As for the individual problem, the member was able to go through the installation part without any 	casualties.</blockquote>

<b>C. Possible solutions</b>
<blockquote>With regards to the problems encountered in point B, for the confusion problem. The team decided to continue with SOFTDEV’s original plan and if the TENTREPS class persists, then the team would just add the requirement for TENTREPS as an added feature for the project without meddling with the original plan.<br>
The added requirement problem will be further discussed with the client.<br>
<b>D. Next steps to accomplish</b>
Try to get an access to the existing system from the previous host of the project and go through with it. Further study yii and php and finalize the client’s added requirement.</blockquote>

<h2>Week 3: February 09  - February 14</h2><br>
<b>A. Tasks accomplished</b>
<blockquote>The team was able to study the framework and try out some of its generators. Playing around with Yii’s bootstrap and site css files is one of the highlights this week.</blockquote>

<b>B. Problems encountered</b>
<blockquote>Since the team was not familiar with the framework and the language used, the scheduled task was not accomplished this week and the team was not able to start working immediately.</blockquote>

<b>C. Possible solutions</b>
<blockquote>More studying and give the team members time to familiarize with the framework and PHP that implies a need to re-adjust the team’s time table or working schedule.</blockquote>

<b>B. Problems encountered</b>
<blockquote>PHP is still new to the team members.  Most of the codes are still unclear although the team is able to read some of it, they are still unable to move freely and make it work in the way they want.</blockquote>

<b>C. Possible solutions</b>
<blockquote>The team does not have time to learn the language and the only solution is to learn PHP as they go along with the project.</blockquote>

<b>D. Next steps to accomplish</b>

<h2>Week 5: February 23  - February 28</h2><br>
<b>A. Tasks accomplished</b>

<blockquote>The team should familiarize themselves with the new template and use another user table for the backend and leave the generated user table to the frontend.</blockquote>

<b>D. Next steps to accomplish</b>
<blockquote>Fix sign-up module for frontend and connect the backend user to another table.</blockquote>
